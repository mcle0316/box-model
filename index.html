			<h2>Coach Helps Young Gymnasts Reach Their Dreams</h2>

	<p>(LINDSAY) Stacey Perreault has been passionate about gymnastics for most of her life.
Beginning in the sport at the age of seven in Oshawa, Ms Perreault says her parents put her in gymnastics to get her active and for the fitness side of things, but once she was chosen to be groomed for the Olympics, the sport took on a much more dominant role in her life.</p>

<p>"We had to put in a lot of hard work. Gymnastics always kind of came first."</p>

<p>But all that hard work paid off, when the young gymnast made Canada's national team at 14. Her best event was vaulting and the gymnast trained for 25-30 hours a week. She kept her motivation to stick with it by focusing on the goal of making the Olympics. She was on the team for four years, and had the honour of competing for Canada in the Commonwealth Games. </p>



	<p>"Doing a sport at that level, it just teaches you that you have to work hard in life to achieve a goal, whatever it is, it teaches you about work ethic," Ms Perreault says.</p>

<p>"Nothing is handed to you, especially in gymnastics, you have to earn every accomplishment."</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a knee injury ended her career right before she was to compete in the trials for the upcoming Olympics, but not before she got to travel to places like France, Romania, Bulgaria and Scotland to compete.</p>

<p>Instead of letting the disappointment of missing out on going to the Olympics sour her to the sport she had loved for so long, Ms Perreault decided to pay her experience forward and started coaching part time.</p>

<p>"I wanted to stay with the sport because it was such a big part of my life," she says.</p>

<p>Now the coach has been with the Lindsay Gymnastics Centre for almost 20 years, and says she is thrilled to work in such a beautiful facility that offers such a wide variety of programs to between 400 and 500 children and adults.</p>

<p>She says she enjoys passing along her knowledge of gymnastics to a new generation of athletes and seeing them blossom as they learn.</p>

<p>"Sometimes it a smile on someone's face when they finally achieve a skill or a three or four-year-old jumping on a trampoline for the first time and seeing their face light up, it's not just one moment, it's little moments all the time."</p>

<p>While she has been with the gym, it has developed solid recreational and competitive programs, says Sandy Creighton, also of the Lindsay Gymnastic Centre, who adds that the knowledge and experience as a high-level athlete that Ms Perreault brings to the job makes her an essential part of the club's success.</p>

<p>She went on to add that the club is fortunate to have a coach of such a high calibre.</p>

<p>"How fortunate we are to have her and we go into competitions knowing our kids are strong technically," Ms Creighton said, adding that since Ms Perreault joined the staff, the club has produced five provincial champions and three of the club's gymnasts competed in Eastern Canada competitions and came home with gold medals.</p>

<p>"We're one of the strongest clubs in the province - our little Kawartha Lakes Club."</p>
